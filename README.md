Hello community
Don't you get the feeling that Nabber's mod is missing something?
Well this adds that missing touch
P.S.: being my first mod expect a lot of errors
the drawings of the textures are not mine but of this mod:https://gitgud.io/Akiya82rjw-pregnancy-stages-graphics
and part of the code of this:https://gitgud.io/Akiya82/slime-girls 
races currently supported: 
Kurin deluxe edition:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670355481 ;
Dragonian Prime Race2.0:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679782347
